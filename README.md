# Changes from Project 1
- Depending on the dimensions of your browser window, the map on the 'Map' page may not appear entirely correct, but the functionality works as intended.
- Added 'Locations' dropdown to the NavBar for easier access to pages.
- Did not implement filter options for 'Reviews' page as we are not currently storing any actual reviews.
